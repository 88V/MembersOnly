### My Experience and challenges: ###

Prior to starting this project I have never worked with C# / .Net in any capacity, or even any sort of database. This was all new. I relentlessly youtubed and googled my way to completion. Seeing how things started to "talk" to each other was the most exciting part. The final icing on the cake was being able to see the project be deployed on the Azure cloud and work from anywhere across the internet. This project really highlighted the value of knowing full stack development.
